My teachers found out that I unblocked Securly and GoGuardian and they got the tech lady to block js from my computer, along with pretty much every website on this giant green rock. Thus, I will not be updating--or be able to update--my scripts, nor will I add any. (InSecurly 1.0.0 needs an update, ASUE 1.0.2 needs an update, Menu de Wilde--)
It was a good run though guys. Pity my repository never got famous.
Lastly, as my going away present to all you javascript nerds like yours truly, I give full access to you to fix, update, or steal my stuff. (If I come back then all of said priveleges are removed.)

Bye :(
